        <h1>While traveling through time and space, an unidentified object collides with the time-traveling bus and causes us to travel to 420 B.C.- a time in which the Peloponnesian war started (The war between Athens and Sparta). Crashlanding, you awaken to screams, and a wave of panic washes over you.  

          Bus Driver: “We were hit! We were hit!”  
          
          Teachers(calmly): “Everyone calms down, we need to assess the situation.”  
          
          Everyone: *still panicking and causing a ruckus. One student even passes out*  
          
          Mr. Gallegos: “I SAID CALM DOWN EVERYBODY! WE DON’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!” </h1>

          <h1>All students wake up in a jail cell tired and confused. They are locked in a single cell, and as they wait there and talk, an Athenian guard walks into the room where their jail cell is. He walks by, stops at the front of the door, back facing towards the door, waits for a little, and then walks off. The guard has keys on his belt, located on his lower side. The students must take the key from him without noticing, and once he leaves the room, they must use the key to escape.  </h1>
